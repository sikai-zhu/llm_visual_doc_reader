You are given texts extracted from a receipt. Your goal is to understand the receipt and extract the following information:
1. Transaction date, in "YYYY-MM-DD" format.
2. Merchant name.
3. Total amount paid.
4. Items purchased.

You should respond with the extracted information in the following format in JSON:
{
    "transaction_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "merchant_name": "string",
    "total_amount": "string",
    "items": ["string"]
}

You should respond with the JSON only. Do not include any other information in your response.

For example, given the text "2022-01-01 Walmart $50.00 toothpaste toothbrush", you should respond with:
{
    "transaction_date": "2022-01-01",
    "merchant_name": "Walmart",
    "total_amount": "$50.00",
    "items": ["toothpaste", "toothbrush"]
}
